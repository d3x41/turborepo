# React-DOM Upgrade Documentation

## Current Situation
- The pull request suggests upgrading react-dom from version 18.2.0 to 18.3.1.
- We were unable to locate the package.json file or any JavaScript/TypeScript files importing react-dom.
- The repository structure differs from initial expectations.

## Recommendations for Manual Upgrade

1. Locate the correct package.json file:
   - Search for any package.json files in the project directory.
   - Identify the one that includes the react-dom dependency.

2. Update dependencies:
   - In the identified package.json, update the following:
     ```json
     "react": "18.3.1",
     "react-dom": "18.3.1"
     ```

3. Install updated dependencies:
   - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` (depending on the package manager used).

4. Review and update related dependencies:
   - Check for any dependencies that rely on specific React or ReactDOM versions.
   - Update these as necessary to maintain compatibility.

5. Test thoroughly:
   - Run the existing test suite.
   - Pay special attention to components using ReactDOM-specific features.
   - Perform both unit and integration tests.
   - Test the application in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

6. Review the changelog:
   - Examine the changelog for react-dom 18.3.0 and 18.3.1.
   - Note any new features, deprecations, or breaking changes that might affect the application.

7. Gradual rollout:
   - Implement a phased rollout in production to monitor for unexpected issues.

8. Monitor and iterate:
   - Closely watch application performance and error rates after the upgrade.
   - Be prepared to quickly address any issues that arise.

## Next Steps
- Manually locate the package.json file and perform the upgrade as outlined above.
- If the file structure significantly differs from expectations, consider reviewing the project setup to ensure all necessary files are present and correctly organized.
